# habit-tracker-pwa
A progressive web app for tracking habits 

### Initial set of functionalities planned

As a user of habit-tracker-pwa, I should be able to 
- Create a new habit
    - Set the name, description
    - Pick a start date and an end date/target
    - Pick a color for the habit
- Edit an existing habit
    - Edit name, desc, start date, end date/target and color
- Delete an existing habit
- View list of habits
- View/Update a habit's progress
    - Calendar view with the current month
    - Ability to move between months in the calendar
    - Dates highlighted whenever the habit was met
    - Mark a day as done for a habit

### Technical considerations

- The application should be a PWA
- The application should support offline mode
- The application should have a responsive layout design
